        <p>Hello! As you may already know, my name is Miguel üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</p>
        <p>
          I'm a front-end developer born and raised in Lisbon. I graduated with
          an I.T. bachelor's degree from the University of Lisbon in 2019 and as
          of late October, 2022 I have 3 years of working experience at
          Talkdesk.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the sides I've also worked on two projects:{" "}

          Slightly clich√© but I would consider myself a global citizen. I have
          friends scattered throughout the world and that's something that has
          deeply shaped my sense of self. I don't see myself being defined or
          limited by the borders of the country that I happened to have been
          born in.

          TRAVEL & INTERESTS
        </h3>
        <p>
          I've so far traveled to the U.S., Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, The
          Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Austria, France, Italy, The
          Vatican and Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top of my bucket list you'll find Australia, New Zealand,
          Japan, South Korea, Iceland, Chile/Argentina (Patagonia specifically).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love colder climates which may sound weird to some people. I'm
          actually quite tired of the constant beaming sun and heat of Lisbon. I
          find it beautiful when places have seasons that are quite bold.
          Flourishing springs, Warm summers, Cozy falls and Snowy winters.
        </p>

          {" "}
          I enjoy capturing my travel experiences but I'm by no means a
          photography expert! In this page you'll have a slider with some of the
          favorite shots that I've taken üì∑
        </p>
        <p>
          I've dabbled in music production, creating animations for storytelling
          and pixel art (even won a Habbo Hotel competition once!) but none of
          those stuck around. I also used to produce Gifs and Photosets on
          Tumblr back in the day.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-area-heading text-start mt-5 mb-4">LANGUAGES</h3>
        <p>
          I only speak two languages fluently: Portuguese and English. Although
          it's worth pointing out that I can easily understand spoken and
          written Spanish.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to learn another Germanic language someday. I already know a
          bit of Norwegian but not enough to have a conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun fact, I don't remember ever actively trying to learn English. I
          was just always somehow able to speak it. How? My theory is that I
          learned it by watching unsubtitled and undubbed Cartoon Network shows.
          So I just started connecting the images and the words that were spoken
          to the point were at the age of 6/8 I'd sometimes forget how to say
          certain words in Portuguese but I'd remember the English equivalent of
          the word. üòÖ
